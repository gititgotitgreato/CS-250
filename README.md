# CS-250
# Finding out what the user needs is easy with a team. This is part of the reason why the Scrum roles exist; the Product Owner can get a good idea of what the customer wants and turn those requests into User Stories in order to simplify it for everyone else, and the Developers turn it into code by using their problem-solving skills, as a Developer should have an excellent logical mindset. This is, in a way, the way I do it if I have to work on something by myself: analyze the problems to be solved, and find ways to do that with the resources required to do so. Therefore, I already use some Agile processes, such as User Stories, on a small scale, and plan to use them like I do now in the future. However, that may change once I become a member of an actual Agile team, and I think a good Agile teammate is understanding of other people, meaning that they get the roles of others and how to blend their own work with others in the process in order to maximize efficiency.
